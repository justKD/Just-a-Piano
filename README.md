# Just a Piano
 
### [This is an old, archived project. It was once available on the iOS app store, but it has not been recently maintained or updated.]

Rather than trying to recreate a physical synth keyboard experience, Just a Piano utilizes the mobile screen space for indepedent dual keyboards.

Each keyboard can be scrolled to an independent note range, and the width/number of keys can be customized in order to suit the user device or preference.
